# Sotn_Tool_Automation

Current Options:
- Tool and Iso Path load
- Safe, Enhanced and Chaotic Elements Randomization
 * All common enemies use Chaotic Randomization, regardless of the option selected ( just randomizes everything)
 * Safe randomization left the bosses untouched ( is the best to use at moment)
 * Enhanced randomization randomizes the boss to be either Weak, Strong or Unnafected by the Element. Immunities/Absorbs were removed.
 * Chaotic Randomization use the same full randomization of enemies , which can leave some bossess unbeatable.
- Multiply factors by x2,x3,x4 and x5 for STR/DEF/HP 
- Multiply factors by 1.25,1.33,1.5 and 2 for LV/EXP

Please, use a clean rom, unless you want re-multiply the current values of monster stats.
